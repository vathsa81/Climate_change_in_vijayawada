    <h3>Climate Change</h3>
    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
      These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s,
      human activities have been the main driver of climate change,
      primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.</p>

    <h3 class="climateHeading">Climate change to make Vijayawada hotter in the next 50 year...</h3>
    <div class="div50">
      <img class="infoImage" src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75188020,imgsize-95669,width-400,resizemode-4/75188020.jpg" alt="no image">
      <p>
        Climate change is likely to have a severe impact on Vijayawada in the next 50 years with the number of days a year over 35°C increasing from the present 95 days to 214 days.
        This in other words means Vijayawada will become warmer with a change in minimum and maximum temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        A research projection on climate change in mega cities across the globe by National Geographic (NG) by 2070 reveals that Vijayawada will likely change from an arid, hot steppe zone to a tropical savanna zone.
        There will also be a marked changed in the number of rainy days.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Vijayawada is in a tropical savanna climate zone marked by intense year-round heat The climate is nearly always warm and humid and average temperatures staying above 18°C every month of the year. Seasons are less defined here than in regions
        closer to the north or south poles. In tropical savannas summers are short, hot, and wet. Intense, tropical rains drop most of their water on the region during the summer,
        but the rest of the year is hot and relatively dry," the NG study said.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the NG study, which warned of a change in zone for Hyderabad by 2070,
        said though the climate conditions in Vijayawada will likely change,
        they are not enough to change its climate zone.
        It will likely change from an arid, hot steppe zone to a tropical savanna zone
      </p>
      <p>
        "One way to get a sense of how Vijayawada might feel in the future is to compare it to somewhere that already experiences those climate conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, by the 2070s, Vijayawada will feel more like Galafi, a city in Djibouti in East Africa, does today, in terms of temperature and precipitation patterns and seasonality," the NG projection said.

<div id="measures" class="measures">
  <h2 class="measures">What should we need to do to control climate change</h2>
  <h3 class="measures">1.Put a price on carbon</h3>
  <p class="measures">
    Carbon pricing systems – such as emissions trading systems that cap emissions or carbon taxes that charge per ton – send a long-term signal to companies by creating an incentive to reduce polluting behaviors and to invest in cleaner energy choices and low-carbon innovation.
  </p>

  <h3 class="measures">2.End fossil fuel subsidies</h3>
  <p class="measures">
    Fossil fuel subsidies send a different signal – one that can encourage waste and discourage low-carbon growth. By phasing out harmful fossil fuel subsidies, countries can reallocate their spending to where it is most needed and most effective, including proving targeted support for the poor.
  </p>

  <h3 class="measures">3.Build low-carbon, resilient cities</h3>
  <p class="measures">
    There will be more infrastructure built in the next 20 years than in the past 6,000, the president told the audience.  Cities are growing fast, particularly in the developing world. Just over half the global population is urban today; by 2050, cities are expected to hold two-thirds of the world population.
  </p>

  <h3 class="measures">4.Increase energy efficiency and use of renewable energy</h3>
  <p class="measures">
    When we talk about energy, we have to talk about access. Worldwide, about 1.2 billion people lack access to electricity and 2.8 billion rely on solid fuels for cooking, such as wood, charcoal, and coal, which cause harmful indoor air pollution.
  </p>
  <p class="measures">
    Through the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, the World Bank Group supports three goals for 2030: to achieve universal access to modern energy, double the rate of improvement in energy efficiency, and double the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.
  </p>

  <h3 class="measures">5.Implement climate-smart agriculture and nurture forest landscapes</h3>
  <p class="measures">
    The fifth area for action takes in both mitigation and adaptation. Climate-smart agriculture techniques help farmers increase their farms’ productivity and resilience to the impacts of climate change, such as droughts, while also creating carbon sinks that help reduce net emissions. Forests, too, are valuable carbon sinks that absorb carbon and store it in soils, trees, and foliage.
