The Climate Action Tracker today spelt out ten important, short-term steps that key sectors need to take to help the world achieve the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C limit.


All key sectors—energy generation, road transport, buildings, industry, forestry and land use, and commercial agriculture—have to begin major efforts to cut emissions by, latest, 2020. By 2025 they should have accelerated these efforts in order to reach globally aggregated zero carbon dioxide emissions by mid-century, and zero greenhouse gas emissions overall roughly in the 2060s.


The full list of Climate Action Tracker’s ten short-term steps:

1)      Electricity:  sustain the growth rate of renewables and other zero and low carbon power until 2025 to reach 100% by 2050

2)      Coal:  no new coal power plants, reduce emissions from coal by at least 30% by 2025

3)      Road transport: last fossil fuel car sold before 2035

4)      Aviation and shipping: develop and get agreement on a 1.5°C compatible vision

5)      New buildings: all new buildings fossil-free and near zero energy by 2020

6)      Building renovation: increase rates from <1% in 2015 to 5% by 2020

7)      Industry:  all new installations in emissions-intensive sectors are low-carbon after 2020; maximise material efficiency

8)      Reduce emissions from forestry and other land use to 95% below 2010 levels by 2030, stop net deforestation by the 2020s

9)      Commercial agriculture:  keep emissions at or below current levels, establish and disseminate regional best practice, ramp up research

10)  CO2 removal: begin research and planning for negative emissions
