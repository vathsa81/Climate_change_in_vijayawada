What Are the Key Elements of Long-Term Strategies?
The scope and depth of long-term strategies are determined by countries. Indeed, there is no one-size-fits-all format or structure. However, some common elements of such strategies include:

1.a long-term vision;
2.sustainable development considerations;
3.mitigation elements (including a long-term quantified outcome for GHG emissions reductions and results of mitigation models and scenarios);
4.adaptation elements;
5.sectoral strategies (including policies and actions, milestones to be achieved over time, information on managing the transition to the long-term goals, among others);
6.implementation approaches;
7.monitoring plans and revision processes.
When these elements are considered together, countries can evaluate tradeoffs among them and ensure that all are supported in the long-term strategy.
